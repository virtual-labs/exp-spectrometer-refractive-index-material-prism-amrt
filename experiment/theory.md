## Theory

When a beam of light strikes on the surface of transparent material(Glass, water, quartz crystal, etc.), the portion of the light is transmitted and other portion is reflected. The transmitted light ray has small deviation of the path from the incident angle. This is called refraction.

  
 Refraction is due to the change in speed of light while passing through the medium. It is given by Snell's Law.

 $$\frac{\sin (i)}{\sin (r)}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}.............(1)$$

Where i s the angle of incident and r is the angle of refraction. And $n_{1}$ s the refractive index of the first face and $n_{2}$ is the refractive index of the second face.
